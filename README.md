## Building the Server Docs

The ownCloud Server documentation is not built independently. Instead, it is built together with the [main documentation](https://github.com/owncloud/docs/). However, you can build a local copy of the ownCloud Server documentation to preview changes you are making.

Whenever a Pull Request of this repo gets merged, it automatically triggers a full docs build.

## General Notes

To make life easier, most of the content written in [docs](https://github.com/owncloud/docs#readme) applies also here. For ease of reading, the most important steps are documented here too. For more information see the link provided. Only a few topics of this repo are unique like the branching.
