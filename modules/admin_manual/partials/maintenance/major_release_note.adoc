[IMPORTANT]
====
When upgrading, also check the minimum and maximum supported PHP version of the ownCloud target release. An ownCloud release may require a particular minimum and/or maximum PHP version. Check that the PHP version provided by the Operating System meets the requirements. For details see the https://doc.owncloud.com/docs_main/next/server_release_notes.html[Server Release Notes] and the xref:{latest-server-version}@server:admin_manual:installation/system_requirements.adoc[System Requirements] for the latest Release.

[TIP]
====
If required, you can skip major releases when upgrading your ownCloud installation. However, we recommend that you first upgrade to the latest point release of your respective minor version, e.g., _10.15.0_.

If you are on ownCloud 8.2.11, 9.0.9, 9.1.X, or 10.X.Y you can go directly to the latest server version.

Here are some examples:
