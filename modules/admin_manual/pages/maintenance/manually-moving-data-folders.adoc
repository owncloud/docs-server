== Introduction

{description}

Though using symbolic links to relocate the data directory can be beneficial, it can be necessary to hard relocate it.
If a hard relocation is required, not only the physical location but also the database has to be updated. 

This guide assumes that:

* The current folder is: `/var/www/owncloud/data`
* The new folder is: `/mnt/owncloud/data`
* You’re using Apache as your webserver
* ownCloud's database name is `owncloud`

Please change the paths above to reflect your environment.

== Summary

The following steps are necessary to move the data directory.

. Stop the web server
. Enable maintenance mode
. Sync your Data directory
. Adjust ownCloud's configuration
. Check permissions
. Disable maintenance mode
. Start the web server

Look at each section below for a detailed description.

== Stop the Web Server

Stopping the web server makes sure there are no active connections to your server.

[source,bash]
----
sudo service apache2 stop
----

== Enable Maintenance Mode

It is necessary to enable maintenance mode to avoid running cron jobs.
To enable maintenance mode, run the following command.

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} maintenance:mode --on
----

== Sync your Data Directory

[source,bash]
----
sudo rsync -avz /var/www/owncloud/data /mnt/owncloud
----

Make sure that `.ocdata` and `.htaccess` were synced to the new directory.

[source,bash]
----
ls -a | grep -i "^\.[A-Z]"
----

== Adjust ownCloud's configuration

=== Adjust oc_storages table

Connect to your database and enter following commands:

[source,sql]
----
use owncloud;
----

=== Update the oc_storages Table

Run the SQL below:

[source,sql]
----
UPDATE oc_storages 
  SET id='local::/mnt/owncloud/data/'
  WHERE id='local::/var/www/owncloud/data/';
----

=== Update the oc_accounts Table

You next need to update the `home` column in the `oc_accounts` table.
This column contains the absolute path for user folders, e.g., `/mnt/owncloud/data/my_user`.

If a user does not have the path already set, you have to identify the users `id` and set the path with the following command, user by user.
This example assumes the user name is `my_user` and their id is `1`. Note that id's are incremental, meaning the account you created first will have id `1` and so on.

Run the SQL below:

[source,sql]
----
UPDATE oc_accounts SET home='/mnt/owncloud/data/my_user'
  WHERE id=1;
----

For all users who already have a path like `/var/www/owncloud/data/` in your database, you can use the `REPLACE` command:

[source,sql]
----
UPDATE oc_accounts 
  SET home = REPLACE(
    home,
    '/var/www/owncloud/data/',
    '/mnt/owncloud/data/'
  );
----

For more information follow the complete MySQL {mysql-string-replace-function-url}[REPLACE] command syntax.

CAUTION: Please don’t copy and paste this example verbatim — nor any of the others. They are examples only.

=== Update the oc_jobs table

The next area to check is the `oc_jobs` table. 
The logrotate process may have hard-coded a non-standard (or old) value for the data path. 
To check it, run the SQL below and see if any results are returned:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM oc_jobs
  WHERE class = 'OC\Log\Rotate';
----

If results are returned, run the SQL below to update them, changing the id value as appropriate.

[source,sql]
----
UPDATE oc_jobs 
  SET argument = REPLACE(
    argument,
    '\\/var\\/www\\/owncloud\\/data\\/',
    '\\/mnt\\/owncloud/data\\/'
  )
  WHERE id = <id of the incorrect record>;
----

CAUTION: The old data path will be written with `\/`.
Therefore you must add one, additional, backslash, like this: `\\/`.

== Fix the config.php Settings

To fix the config.php settings:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:system:set --value /mnt/owncloud/data datadirectory
----

=== Adjust config.php

. Change the `datadirectory` key in your `config.php` to the new path.
  To do so, start an editor of your choice and open `/var/www/owncloud/config/config.php`

. Change the value of the key from `'datadirectory' => '/var/www/owncloud/data',` to `'datadirectory' => '/mnt/owncloud/data',`.

== Disable Maintenance Mode

To disable maintenance mode of your instance run the following command:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} maintenance:mode --off
----

== Start the Web Server

[source,bash]
----
sudo service apache2 start
----

== Scan the Files

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} files:scan --all
----
