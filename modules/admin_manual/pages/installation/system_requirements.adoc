There is an important note about a xref:installation/manual_installation/manual_installation_prerequisites.adoc#openssl-version[prerequisite of openSSL]. We highly recommend checking this prerequisite as it needs to be checked regardless of the Operating System chosen.

== Officially Recommended Environment

For _best performance_, _stability_, _support_ and _full functionality_, we officially recommend and support:

[NOTE]
====
For Linux distributions, we support, if technically feasible, the latest two versions per platform and the previous LTS Version.

* VMware ESX - ownCloud must run without overcommitment of cores or RAM for larger installations (1000+ users).
* Xen
* KVM

=== Web Browser

* Edge (current version on Windows 10)
* IE11 or newer (except Compatibility Mode)
* Firefox 60 ESR+
* Chrome 66+

=== Desktop Sync Client

We always recommend to use the newest sync client with the latest server release.

You can find {desktop-system-requirements-url}[detailed system requirements] in the documentation for the Desktop Synchronization Client.

We always recommend to use the newest mobile apps with the latest server release.

You can find detailed system requirements in the documentation for the mobile apps.

== Database Requirements

The following database settings are currently required if youâ€™re running ownCloud together with a MySQL or MariaDB database:

* Disabled or `BINLOG_FORMAT = MIXED` or `BINLOG_FORMAT = ROW` configured Binary Logging (See: xref:configuration/database/linux_database_configuration.adoc#mysql-mariadb[MySQL / MariaDB with Binary Logging Enabled])
* InnoDB storage engine (The MyISAM storage engine is *not supported*, see:
xref:configuration/database/linux_database_configuration.adoc#mysql-mariadb[MySQL / MariaDB storage engine])
* `READ COMMITTED` transaction isolation level (See:
xref:configuration/database/linux_database_configuration.adoc#set-read-committed-as-the-transaction-isolation-level[MySQL / MariaDB `READ COMMITTED` transaction isolation level])

== Memory Requirements

Memory requirements for running an ownCloud server are greatly variable, depending on the numbers of users and files, and volume of server activity. ownCloud officially requires a minimum of 128MB RAM.
But, we recommend a minimum of 512MB.
