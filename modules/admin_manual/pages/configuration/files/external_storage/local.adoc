= Local Storage
:toc: right
:description: Local storage provides the ability to mount any directory on your ownCloud server

== Introduction

IMPORTANT: *Using local storage is a security risk, only use it if you know what you are doing.*

{description} that is:

* Outside of your ownCloud `data/` directory
* Both readable and writable by your web server user

== Details

As this setup diffuses the difference between ownCloud Admin and sysadmin, this is a significant security risk and therefore off by default.

[WARNING]
====
* *Only enable local storage if ownCloud Admin and sysadmin are the same person on purpose.*
* A local ownCloud mount does not work well with external storages like SMB or FTP mounted in the Linux filesystem. If such a Linux mounted storage goes away, ownCloud is likely to see the underlying empty mountpoint as a perfectly valid folder and will _silently_ propagate content deletion, instead of forwarding error messages to the end users.
====

In any case, local storage is only configurable via the ownCloud admin settings. Non-admin users cannot create local storage mounts.

See
xref:installation/manual_installation/manual_installation.adoc#script-guided-installation[Set Correct Permissions]
for information on correct file permissions, and find your HTTP user

To enable Local storage, you must first enable it by editing your ownCloud installationâ€™s `config/config.php` file adding the following configuration key:

[source,php]
----
'files_external_allow_create_new_local' => 'true',
----

To manage local storage, navigate to menu:Settings[Admin > Storage]. You can see an example in the screenshot below.

. In the *Folder name* field enter the folder name that you want to appear on your ownCloud Files page. 
. In the *Configuration* field enter the full file path of the directory you want to mount. 
. In the *Available for* field enter the users or groups who have permission to access the mount; by default all users have access.

See
xref:configuration/files/external_storage/configuration.adoc[External Storage Configuration]
for additional mount options and information, and
