:description: ownCloud provides a simple version control system for files. Versioning creates backups of files which are accessible via the Versions tab on the Details sidebar.

== The Versions Tab

This tab contains the history of the file where you can roll back a file to any previous version. Changes made at intervals greater than two minutes are saved as versions.

* To restore a specific version of a file, click the btn:[circular arrow] to the
left.
* Click on the btn:[timestamp] to download it.
* If the Admin has enabled to show the author of a version in the versions history, ownCloud can automatically generate version numbers. Based on this feature, the user can define the actual version to be a major version which gets a major version number and all new upcoming versions start counting from this major number. The user has to click on the btn:[check mark] on the left of the actual version to publish it as major version.
* If you want to make a former version a major version, restore the former version first and make it a major version afterwards.

The versioning app expires old versions automatically to make sure that the user doesn’t run out of space. The following pattern is used to delete old versions:

* For the first second we keep one version
* For the first 10 seconds ownCloud keeps one version every 2 seconds
* For the first minute ownCloud keeps one version every 10 seconds
* For the first hour ownCloud keeps one version every minute
* For the first 24 hours ownCloud keeps one version every hour
* For the first 30 days ownCloud keeps one version every day
* After the first 30 days ownCloud keeps one version every week

The versions are adjusted along this pattern every time a new version gets created.

The version app never uses more that 50% of the user’s currently available free space. If the stored versions exceed this limit, ownCloud deletes the oldest versions until it meets the disk space limit again.
