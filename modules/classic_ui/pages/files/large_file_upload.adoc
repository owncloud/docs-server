= Large File Uploads
:description: When uploading files through the web client, ownCloud is limited by the server configuration. We recommend that your ownCloud admin updates the server environment to sizes appropriate for users.

{description}

Modifying certain ownCloud variables requires administrative access. If
you require larger upload limits than have been provided by the default
(or already set by your administrator):

* Contact your administrator to request an increase in these variables
* Refer to the section in the
xref:{latest-server-version}@server:admin_manual:configuration/files/big_file_upload_configuration.adoc[Admin Documentation] that describes how to manage file upload size limits.
